# Fix for "Task does not exist" Error

## Problem

Your error shows:

```
Error: Failed to approve submission: Error: execution reverted: "Task does not exist"
...
"to": "0x1744505ae24f747C0D92343206E658c09EF69CDC"
...
at BlockchainService.approveSubmission (D:\new-celo\server\src\services\blockchain.service.ts:99:13)
```

This means you have **two different projects**:

1. **This project** (`C:\Users\RAJ\OneDrive\Desktop\micro-job-ai-agent-web3`)

   - Contract: `0xa520d207c91C0FE0e9cFe8D63AbE02fd18B2254e` ✅
   - Working correctly

2. **Other project** (`D:\new-celo`)
   - Contract: `0x1744505ae24f747C0D92343206E658c09EF69CDC` ❌
   - Task doesn't exist on this contract

## Why Transaction Hash is "pending"

The frontend shows "pending" because:

1. ✅ AI verification passed → submission marked as "APPROVED"
2. ❌ Blockchain payment failed → no transaction hash created
3. ⚠️ Frontend showed "approved" based on database status, not blockchain status

## Solution

### Option 1: Fix the D:\new-celo project (Recommended)

Navigate to the other project and run diagnostics:

```bash
cd D:\new-celo\server
npx tsx show-env-info.ts
npx tsx diagnose-task-mismatch.ts
```

Then either:

- **A)** Update `CONTRACT_ADDRESS` in `D:\new-celo\server\.env` to match where the task was created
- **B)** Create a new task with the current contract:
  ```bash
  npx tsx create-task-with-blockchain.ts
  ```
- **C)** Mark old tasks as expired:
  ```bash
  npx tsx cleanup-old-tasks.ts
  ```

### Option 2: Use THIS project (Current workspace)

This project is working correctly! Just use it instead of `D:\new-celo`.

## What I Fixed

### 1. Better Error Handling ✅

The verification worker now:

- ✅ Checks if blockchain payment succeeds
- ✅ Reverts submission to "REJECTED" if blockchain fails
- ✅ Shows clear error message about contract mismatch
- ✅ Prevents showing "approved" when payment fails

### 2. Clearer Error Messages ✅

Blockchain service now shows:

```
Task 1 not found on contract 0x1744505ae24f747C0D92343206E658c09EF69CDC.
This task may have been created on a different contract.
Check CONTRACT_ADDRESS in .env matches the contract used to create this task.
```

### 3. Frontend Will Now Show ❌

After these fixes:

- If blockchain payment fails → submission status reverts to REJECTED
- Frontend will show "Rejected" with error message
- Transaction hash will only show if blockchain payment succeeds

## Quick Check

Run this in **D:\new-celo\server**:

```bash
# Check environment
npx tsx show-env-info.ts

# Check which contract is configured
echo %CONTRACT_ADDRESS%

# Or in PowerShell
$env:CONTRACT_ADDRESS
```

Then compare with the contract in the error: `0x1744505ae24f747C0D92343206E658c09EF69CDC`

If they don't match, update your `.env` file.

## To Test the Fix

1. Go to `D:\new-celo\server`
2. Create a fresh task:
   ```bash
   npx tsx create-task-with-blockchain.ts
   ```
3. Submit to the new task
4. Verify it completes with a real transaction hash
