/**
 * HOW TO FIX THE PAYMENT ISSUE
 * ============================
 * 
 * PROBLEM IDENTIFIED:
 * - Tasks were created in database without blockchain contracts (contractTaskId is null)
 * - When verification passes, payment fails because there's no smart contract to release funds
 * - Verification shows "approved" but payment stays "pending"
 * 
 * ROOT CAUSE:
 * - Tasks created via seed script or test data skip blockchain creation
 * - The requester wallet (0x1234567890123456789012345678901234567890) is a dummy address
 * 
 * SOLUTION:
 * ========
 * 
 * To create a REAL task that works with payments, you MUST:
 * 
 * 1. Use a REAL wallet address (like the one from MetaMask: 0xa0e793e7257c065b30c46ef6828f2b3c0de87a8e)
 * 2. Create the task through the API endpoint POST /api/v1/tasks/create
 * 3. The API will:
 *    a. Check requester has sufficient cUSD balance
 *    b. Create task on blockchain (smart contract)
 *    c. Store contractTaskId in database
 *    d. Worker will be assigned on blockchain when they submit
 *    e. Payment will be released when verification approves
 * 
 * STEPS TO CREATE A WORKING TASK:
 * ===============================
 * 
 * 1. Make sure you have cUSD in your wallet on Celo Sepolia testnet
 *    - Get testnet CELO from: https://faucet.celo.org
 *    - Swap CELO for cUSD on Uniswap or Mento
 * 
 * 2. Use the frontend or API to create a task:
 *    
 *    POST http://localhost:3001/api/v1/tasks/create
 *    Headers:
 *      X-Wallet-Address: YOUR_WALLET_ADDRESS
 *    Body:
 *    {
 *      "title": "Verify this text",
 *      "description": "Check if text makes sense",
 *      "taskType": "text_verification",
 *      "paymentAmount": 0.01,
 *      "verificationCriteria": {
 *        "aiPrompt": "Verify if the text makes sense",
 *        "requiredFields": ["text"]
 *      },
 *      "maxSubmissions": 1,
 *      "expiresAt": "2025-11-01T00:00:00Z"
 *    }
 * 
 * 3. The API will:
 *    - Create task on blockchain
 *    - Return contractTaskId
 *    - Store task in database
 * 
 * 4. Worker submits → Verification runs → Payment releases automatically!
 * 
 * 
 * WHAT WAS FIXED:
 * ==============
 * 
 * 1. verification.worker.ts:
 *    - Added check for null contractTaskId
 *    - Reverts verification status to "rejected" if contractTaskId is missing
 *    - Sends proper error notification to worker
 *    - Prevents payment from getting stuck in "pending" state
 * 
 * 2. payment.service.ts:
 *    - Created TypeScript version for better type safety
 *    - Improved error handling and retry logic
 *    - Better logging for debugging
 * 
 * 
 * FOR YOUR CURRENT STALLED SUBMISSIONS:
 * ====================================
 * 
 * The existing submissions (like bd89924f-39e1-453c-a94c-a9eb99455e5c) cannot be paid
 * because their tasks don't have blockchain contracts. You need to:
 * 
 * 1. Create NEW tasks with blockchain integration
 * 2. Have workers submit to those new tasks
 * 3. Verification and payment will work automatically
 * 
 * The worker IS running correctly - you just need tasks with proper blockchain setup!
