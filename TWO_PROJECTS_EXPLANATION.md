# Understanding the Two Projects Issue

## The Problem

You have **two separate project instances** on different drives that are interfering with each other:

### ‚úÖ Current Workspace (Primary)

- **Location**: `C:\Users\RAJ\OneDrive\Desktop\micro-job-ai-agent-web3`
- **Status**: ‚úÖ Working perfectly
- **Contract**: `0xa520d207c91C0FE0e9cFe8D63AbE02fd18B2254e`
- **cUSD**: `0x845D9D0B4Be004Dcbc17b11160B0C18abBD5FEBD`

### ‚ùå Other Instance (External)

- **Location**: `D:\new-celo\server`
- **Status**: ‚ùå Has mismatched contracts
- **Contract**: `0x1744505ae24f747C0D92343206E658c09EF69CDC`
- **Problem**: Task doesn't exist on this contract
- **Error**: This is where the "Task does not exist" error comes from!

---

## Why You're Seeing the Error

### Error Trace Analysis

```
Error: Failed to approve submission...
at BlockchainService.approveSubmission (D:\new-celo\server\src\services\blockchain.service.ts:99:13)
                                         ‚Üë
                        This shows it's from the OTHER project!
```

The backend process running is from `D:\new-celo`, not the current workspace.

### Timeline of What Happened

1. You created a task with contract `0xa520d207c91C0FE0e9cFe8D63AbE02fd18B2254e` ‚úÖ
2. Frontend client was pointing to old address `0xA0e793E7257c065b30c46Ef6828F2B3C0de87A8E` ‚ùå
3. When you tried to verify, it called the `D:\new-celo` backend
4. That backend has contract `0x1744505ae24f747C0D92343206E658c09EF69CDC` ‚ùå
5. Task doesn't exist there ‚Üí "Task does not exist" error

---

## The Solution

### Step 1: Verify You're Using the Right Backend

Check which server you're running:

```bash
# Check current directory
pwd  # Should show: C:\Users\RAJ\OneDrive\Desktop\micro-job-ai-agent-web3\server

# Check environment
npx tsx show-env-info.ts
# Should show: 0xa520d207c91C0FE0e9cFe8D63AbE02fd18B2254e
```

### Step 2: Verify Client is Using Right Addresses

Check client `.env.local`:

```bash
cat .env.local  # or `type .env.local` on Windows
# Should show:
# NEXT_PUBLIC_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=0xa520d207c91C0FE0e9cFe8D63AbE02fd18B2254e
# NEXT_PUBLIC_CUSD_ADDRESS=0x845D9D0B4Be004Dcbc17b11160B0C18abBD5FEBD
```

‚úÖ Both are now correct!

### Step 3: Restart Everything

```bash
# Kill all running processes first!

# Terminal 1: Server
cd C:\Users\RAJ\OneDrive\Desktop\micro-job-ai-agent-web3\server
npm run dev

# Terminal 2: Client
cd C:\Users\RAJ\OneDrive\Desktop\micro-job-ai-agent-web3\client
npm run dev
```

### Step 4: Test End-to-End

1. Go to http://localhost:3000
2. Create a new task (this will use the correct contract)
3. Submit to the task
4. Wait for AI verification
5. Check for transaction hash (now should work!)

## Understanding Contract Addresses

### Why Multiple Addresses?

When testing, you may deploy multiple contracts:

1. **First Deploy**: `0xA0e793E7257c065b30c46Ef6828F2B3C0de87A8E` (Old)

   - Tests, experiments
   - Tasks from this are lost

2. **Second Deploy**: `0xa520d207c91C0FE0e9cFe8D63AbE02fd18B2254e` (Current ‚úÖ)

   - New setup with correct cUSD
   - All current tasks here

3. **Other Project**: `0x1744505ae24f747C0D92343206E658c09EF69CDC` (External)
   - Different project instance
   - Different contract

### Why Old Tasks Don't Work

- Old tasks reference old contract
- New contract doesn't know about them
- Trying to use old task ID on new contract ‚Üí "Task does not exist"

### Solution: Always Use Latest Contract

Keep `.env` files updated with:

- **Latest deployed contract address**
- **Latest deployed cUSD token address**
- Both frontend and backend must match!

---

## What Each Environment Variable Does

### Server `.env`

```
CONTRACT_ADDRESS=0xa520d207c91C0FE0e9cFe8D63AbE02fd18B2254e
‚Üë Used to create tasks, approve payments, interact with blockchain
```

### Client `.env.local`

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=0xa520d207c91C0FE0e9cFe8D63AbE02fd18B2254e
‚Üë Used by frontend (public = visible in browser code)
```

**They must match!** Otherwise frontend sends task to wrong contract.

---

## How to Avoid This in Future

### For Deployments

1. Deploy new contract
2. Update **BOTH** `.env` files
3. Restart **BOTH** server and client
4. Test with new task

### Checklist

- [ ] Server `.env` updated
- [ ] Client `.env.local` updated
- [ ] Server restarted
- [ ] Client restarted
- [ ] New task created (not old one)
- [ ] Test end-to-end

### Monitor Logs

```bash
# Server should show
Connected to: 0xa520d207c91C0FE0e9cFe8D63AbE02fd18B2254e

# Client should make requests to localhost:3001
# which connects to same contract
```

## What About D:\new-celo?

If you want to use that project too:

1. **Diagnose it**:

   ```bash
   cd D:\new-celo\server
   npx tsx show-env-info.ts
   ```

2. **Fix it**:

   - Update `D:\new-celo\server\.env` to use correct contract
   - Update `D:\new-celo\client\.env.local` to match
   - OR create fresh tasks with its current contract

3. **Keep them separate**:
   - Never run both servers at same time on port 3001
   - They'll interfere with each other
